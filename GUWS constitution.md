*Last major update: 2023-08-15* v1.1

1.	**NAME**
	1.	Glasgow University Worldbuilding & Storytelling society (GUWS)

2.	**PURPOSES**
	1.	GUWS exists to provide students an outlet for creativity through worldbuilding and storytelling. We aspire to encourage learning about society, history, and culture, and will provide a social space for people of similar creative interests to gather

3.	**ACTIVITIES**
	1.	GUWS will host an array of activities centred around worldbuilding and storytelling, potentially including but not limited to; a book club, roleplaying games, collaborative worldbuilding events, movie nights, and other such events
	2.	Activities and events will be announced through the newsletter & [src page](https://www.glasgowunisrc.org/organisation/guws/). They may also be listed on the GUWS discord server

4.	**CODE OF CONDUCT**
	1.	At events, we are all bound to the [university's code of conduct](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/senateoffice/policies/uniregs/regulations2020-21/feesandgeneral/studentsupportandconductmatters/reg33/)
	2.	Additionally, we have some rules of our own:
		1.	Don't be a bigot
			1.	Bigotry including but not limited to, homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, ableism, faith-based prejudice, etc.
		2.	Try to respect and care for one another
		3.	Don't make fun of others for things they can't control
		4.	Assume good faith. Not everyone will be aware that saying X, Y, or Z is bigoted, so calmly informing them and helping them do better is a lot more helpful than getting mad.
		5.	Try not to act in conflict with the society
	3.	When these rules are violated, the committee shall decide the further course of action, including but not limited to requesting an apology, suspending membership, or revoking membership.
	4.	In the event of serious incidents, the offense shall be referred to the University Senate.
	5.	In the events of gender-based violence and sexual assault, we will seek specialist support (SRC Advise Centre) in order to resolve the issue. These will be treated with utmost care and resolved in a way amenable to the victim.

5.	**DONATIONS**
	1.	The society shall take donations through our [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/guws0)
	2.	Donations are not required for membership, nor do they give you greater voting power in the society

	4.	Certain events may be donator-exclusive, however this will not be common

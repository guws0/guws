# Constitution of the Glasgow University Worldbuilding & Storytelling society (GUWS)
*Last major update: 2024-09-08* v3.0

1. 	**NAME**
        1.1. Glasgow University Worldbuilding & Storytelling society (GUWS)

2. 	**PURPOSES**
        2.1. GUWS exists to provide students an outlet for creativity through worldbuilding and storytelling. We aspire to encourage learning about society, history, and culture, and will provide a social space for people with similar creative interests to gather.

3. 	**ACTIVITIES**
        3.1. GUWS will host an array of activities centred around worldbuilding and storytelling, potentially including but not limited to; a book club, roleplaying games, collaborative worldbuilding events, movie nights, and other such events.
        3.2. Activities and events will be announced through the newsletter & [src page](https://www.glasgowunisrc.org/organisation/guws/). They may also be listed on the GUWS discord server.

4. 	**CODE OF CONDUCT**
        4.1. At events, we are all bound to the [university's code of conduct](https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/senateoffice/policies/uniregs/regulations2020-21/feesandgeneral/studentsupportandconductmatters/reg33/)
        4.2. Additionally, we have some rules of our own:
            4.2.1. Don't be a bigot
                4.2.1.1. Bigotry including but not limited to, homophobia, transphobia, racism, sexism, ableism, faith-based prejudice, etc.
            4.2.2. Try to respect and care for one another
            4.2.3. Don't make fun of others for things they can't control
            4.2.4. Assume good faith. Not everyone will be aware that saying X, Y, or Z is bigoted, so calmly informing them and helping them do better is a lot more helpful than getting mad.
            4.2.5. Try not to act in conflict with the society
        4.3. When these rules are violated, the committee shall decide the further course of action.
            4.3.1. On first instance of a violation the offender will be informed of the rule(s) that they have violated and given an official warning. This warning may be given in person or through online messaging.
            4.3.2. On further violations, the committee may decide to suspend or ban the offender from GUWS events and the GUWS discord server. In the case of suspensions, the offender will also be asked to apologise and may be given a further official warning.
            4.3.3. In either of these cases, the committee will first form a sub-committee of office-bearers unnamed in the complaint to make final decisions and inform offenders of these outcomes.
                4.3.3.1. This sub-committee will consist of the Welfare Officer (unless involved in the offence/incident) and two other office bearers uninvolved in the offence.
            4.3.4. If the sub-committee judges a first violation to be particularly serious, or if multiple violations are made before a warning can be given, the sub-committee may enforce an immediate suspension or ban from the society’s events and Discord server instead of the process detailed in 4.3.1. The sub-committee will do this only if all involved office-bearers agree unanimously on the decision.
            4.3.5. In severe cases or where the University’s Code of Student Conduct is breached, the committee must refer to section 10.4 of this document.
            4.3.6. In cases involving Gender-based Violence or Sexual Assault, the committee must refer to section 10.5 of this document

5. 	**DONATIONS**
        5.1. The society shall take donations through our [Ko-fi page](https://ko-fi.com/guws0)

        5.5. Donations will be used to improve the society
